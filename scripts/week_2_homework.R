hw2
# Problem 1: Take your hw2 vector and removed all the NAs then select all the numbers between 14 and 38 inclusive, call this vector prob1

# remove NAs
prob1 <- hw2[!is.na(hw2)]
prob1

# select all numbers inclusive between 14 and 38
prob1 <- prob1[prob1 >= 14 & prob1 <= 38]
prob1

# Problem 2: Multiply each number in the prob1 vector by 3 to create a new vector called times3. Then add 10 to each number in your times3 vector to create a new vector called plus10.

# multiply each number by 3
times3 <- prob1*3
times3

# add 10 to each number
plus10 <- times3+10
plus10

# Problem 3: Select every other number in your plus10 vector by selecting the first number, not the second, the third, not the fourth, etc. If youâ€™ve worked through these three problems in order, you should now have a vector that is 12 numbers long that looks exactly like this one:
final <- plus10[c(TRUE, FALSE)]
final
