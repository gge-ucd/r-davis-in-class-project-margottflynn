# Using the iris data frame (this is built in to R), create a new variable that categorizes petal length into three groups:
#small (less than or equal to the 1st quartile)
#medium (between the 1st and 3rd quartiles)
#large (greater than or equal to the 3rd quartile)
#Hint: Explore the iris data using summary(iris$Petal.Length), to see the petal 
#length distribution. Then use your function of choice: ifelse() or case_when() to 
#make a new variable named petal.length.cat based on the conditions listed above. 
#Note that in the iris data frame there are no NAs, so we donâ€™t have to deal with 
#them here.
